# Audio Mixpoints

This is a Web Audio API experiment in full client-side JS.

Demo that computes mixpoints on several audio files, then creates a playlist that play songs one by one, chaining themselves naturally. Everything with client-side Javascript and Web Audio API! Inspired from RadioDJ mixpoints computing philosophy.
